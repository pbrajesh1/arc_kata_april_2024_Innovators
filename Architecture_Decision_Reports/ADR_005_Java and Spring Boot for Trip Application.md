# Title: Use Java and Spring Boot for Trip Application

## Status

APPROVED

## Context

We are developing the Trip Application which is the most critical backend service that requires high availability, scalability, reliability, and compatibility. We need to choose a programming language and a framework that can support these requirements and facilitate the development of microservices.


## Decision

* We decide to use Java and Spring Boot for our microservice application. 
* Java is a popular, versatile, and mature programming language that has a large and active community of developers, a rich set of libraries and frameworks, and a high level of portability and performance. 
* Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the development of Java-based microservices by providing features such as auto-configuration, embedded servers, dependency injection, health checks, metrics, security, and cloud integration. 
* Spring Boot also integrates well with Spring Cloud, which is a collection of tools and libraries that support common patterns and challenges in microservice architectures.


## Consequences

By using Java and Spring Boot for our microservice application, we can expect to achieve several benefits, such as:
* We can create microservices quickly and easily by eliminating boilerplate code and configuration. We can focus on the business logic and functionality of our microservices rather than the infrastructure and plumbing.
* We can scale our microservices horizontally by running them on multiple instances and distributing the load among them. We can also scale them vertically by leveraging the multi-core and multi-threading capabilities of modern hardware.
* We can build resilient microservices that can handle failures gracefully and recover quickly. 
* We can also ensure the consistency and quality of our microservices by using transaction management, exception handling, logging, and monitoring.
* We can create interoperable microservices that can communicate with each other using standard protocols and formats. 
* We can also integrate our microservices with various data sources, messaging systems, cloud platforms, and third-party services.
However, We also need to be aware of some challenges or trade-offs that We may face by using Java and Spring Boot for our microservice application, such as: 
* We need to have a good understanding of the concepts, principles, patterns, and best practices of microservice architecture. 
* We also need to be familiar with the various components, dependencies, configurations, and conventions of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
* We need to implement proper authentication, authorization, encryption, auditing, etc. across multiple services and endpoints.
